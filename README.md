### ðŸ“œ About This Project

This project was created as part of a course requirement at Western Governors University. It demonstrates my proficiency with core web development skills including semantic HTML, CSS layout, JavaScript interactivity, and form handling.

> ðŸ’€ **Disclaimer:** Some stylistic or technical choices in this project were made to satisfy rubric requirementsâ€”not because they reflect best practices or my personal standards as a developer. Think of it as a wizard casting spells from a dated scrollâ€”not because they _should_, but because the council demands it.

The goal here wasnâ€™t perfectionâ€”it was proof. This project showcases my ability to meet the specified criteria while still injecting creativity, structure, and a little bit of flair. The result: a functional portfolio page with a sense of humor, a magical theme, and evidence that I can absolutely build things by the book... even if I wouldnâ€™t write the book that way.
