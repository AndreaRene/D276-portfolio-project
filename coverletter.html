        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <p>
          I’m excited to apply for the Full Stack Developer position at your company. With a strong foundation in
          <mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>React</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, and both SQL and NoSQL databases, I bring a
          practical, hands-on approach to building real-world applications that are functional, scalable, and
          user-friendly.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my current role as a Teaching Assistant for the EdX Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at the University of Texas,
          I support adult learners as they pivot into tech careers. This experience has sharpened my technical skills,
          improved my ability to explain complex concepts clearly, and reminded me daily why collaboration and
          mentorship matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code, working with diverse teams, and always learning
          something new. Whether it's debugging a GraphQL resolver or guiding someone through their first deployment, I
          bring curiosity, patience, and a solid problem-solving mindset to every challenge.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’d love the opportunity to bring that mindset to your team and help build great software with real impact.
          Thank you for considering my application — I look forward to hearing from you.
        </p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Andrea Ren&eacute; Presto</p>
